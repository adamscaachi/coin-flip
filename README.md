# Electronic Coin Flip 

- Electronic noise from an unconnected analog pin of an Arduino is used to set the seed of a random number generator.
- A random bit (0 or 1) is generated when the button is pressed.
- If the bit value is 0 then the yellow LED is activated, otherwise the red LED is activated.
- Any activated LED will deactivate a second later.
